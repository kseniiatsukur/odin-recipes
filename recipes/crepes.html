    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These savory buckwheat crepes go well with any sort of condiments.</p>
    <p>I like to put some cheese in a line across the center and fold both sides in to look like a wrap.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons buckwheat flour</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in milk and whisk to combine. Gradually add 1 1/2 cups plus 2 1/2 tablespoons buckwheat flour and whole wheat flour, whisking to combine.<br>
            Don't be afraid if the mixture looks too watery; it works well. Stir in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.</li><br>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Brush the bottom with a little oil and pour in 1 ladle of batter in a swirl, so it spreads evenly into a thin layer. <br>
            Cook until bubbles form and crepe is browned on the bottom, 1 to 3 minutes, then flip and repeat on the other side. Remove to a plate and repeat to cook remaining crepes, adding more oil as needed.</li>
    </ol>
