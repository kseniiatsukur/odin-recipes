    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lentils and buckwheat simmer to make a hearty stew. This is a typical 'zuppa' for a winter evening in Italy. </p>
    <p>Serve with crusty bread topped with a bit of extra virgin olive oil. Typical to most Italian food, this is healthy and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown lentils</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, grated</li>
        <li>1 small carrot, grated</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups low-sodium vegetable broth, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup raw buckwheat groats</li>
        <li>1 (9 ounce) package fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak lentils in a bowl of cold water for 1 hour. Drain and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stew pot over medium heat. Add grated onion and carrot and saute until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. <br>
            Add lentils and bay leaves and stir until coated with oil. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth, stir, and bring to a boil. Leave at a slow boil for 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Reduce heat to a simmer and add buckwheat. Simmer until lentils are soft but not mushy and buckwheat is cooked through, about 25 minutes, adding remaining broth if needed. <br>
            Remove from the heat and fold in fresh spinach until wilted. Remove bay leaves.</li><br>
        <li>Serve hot with a 1/2 tablespoon olive oil drizzled on top of each portion.</li>
