    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Buckwheat is a healthy side dish containing all 9 of the essential amino acids. It's very popular in Europe. 
        Buckwheat is gluten free, as it's not a grain.</p>
    <p>This recipe is not as quick as a plain basic way to cook buckwheat, but it's so worth it and smells and tastes so good. 
        Serve hot with a small piece of butter on top.</p>
